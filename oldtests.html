      <h2>Unit tests</h2>
      <p><a href="https://github.com/teal-duck/teal-duck/blob/Assessment-2/teal-duck-all-tests.jar?raw=true">Get our executable testing file here.</a> (.jar, ~2.3MB)</p>
      <p>Run it by opening your terminal, navigating to the folder where you downloaded the .jar, and entering <code>java -jar teal-duck-all-tests.jar</code>.</p>
      <p>Currently, our test suite runs with 2 errors. These are both due to a single bug that we identified late in development, and did not have time to correct. This bug is identified clearly in our code, and our playtests show that it has no noticable impact during normal gameplay.</p>

      <h2>Acceptance tests</h2>
      <p>Much of the functionality of the game is very difficult to display in a unit test, so is most easily tested by playing the game with visual inspection of correct functionality.</p>
      <p>The following table provides a list of expected functionality, and how to observe this functionality expressed in the execution of the game.</p>
